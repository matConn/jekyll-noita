This is a blog by Matthew Connelly, documenting his discoveries and experiments working primarily in Web Development and with Linux.   

Matt loves games and emulators, reviving old machines with Linux, and scripting for the web with JavaScript.

His text editor of choice is Visual Studio Code or Vim, and his development environment is something *nix; Ubuntu, Mac, or ChromeOS.

This blog is powered by Github Pages and by flat-CMS [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Theme used is [Noita](https://github.com/penibelst/jekyll-noita). Google Analytics is used for monitoring traffic, and Disqus is used for handling comments. Posts are occasionally edited with [Prose](http://prose.io/).
