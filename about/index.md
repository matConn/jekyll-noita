This is a web development blog by Matthew Connelly, documenting his adventures, misadventures, and discoveries in the field.  

Matthew loves playing N64 games in emulators, reviving old machines with Linux, scripting animations and interactions for the web, and writing in third person.

This blog is powered by Github pages and by flat-CMS [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/); a nice way to write a blog post in Markdown. The theme used is [Noita](https://github.com/penibelst/jekyll-noita). Google Analytics is used for monitoring web traffic, but for fast load times, no other scripts have been used. Posts are occasionally edited with [Prose](http://prose.io/).
