This is a web development blog by Matthew Connelly, documenting his adventures, misadventures, and discoveries in the field, as well as his experiments at home.  

Matthew loves playing N64 games in emulators, reviving old machines with Linux, scripting animations and interactions for the web with JavaScript, and writing in third person.

His text editor of choice is Visual Studio Code or Vim when things get headless, and his development environment is something *nix; Ubuntu, Mac, or ChromeOS. He also loves mechanical keyboards but promises not to use one next to you.

This blog is powered by Github pages and by flat-CMS [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and a lot of coffee. The theme used is [Noita](https://github.com/penibelst/jekyll-noita). Google Analytics is used for monitoring web traffic so that way I'll know when I'm famous. Posts are occasionally edited with [Prose](http://prose.io/).
