I'm Matthew Connelly; a web developer with a BS in communications from The College of Staten Island. I'm currently pursuing a BS in computer science at the same college, and I previously worked as a frontend developer for The Charles NYC.  

This blog is where I write about [projects](https://github.com/mattConn) I've been working on and anything interesting I might discover during the development process.  

This blog is powered by Github Pages and by flat-CMS [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Theme used is [Noita](https://github.com/penibelst/jekyll-noita). Google Analytics is used for monitoring traffic, and Disqus is used for handling comments.
