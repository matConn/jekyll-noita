This is a web development blog by Matthew Connelly documenting his adventures, misadventures, and discoveries in the field.   

Matthew loves N64 games and emulators, reviving old machines with Linux, scripting animations and interactions for the web with JavaScript, and writing in third person.

His text editor of choice is Visual Studio Code or Vim for when things get headless, and his development environment is something *nix; Ubuntu, Mac, or ChromeOS. He also loves mechanical keyboards but promises not to use one next to you.

This blog is powered by Github Pages and by flat-CMS [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Theme used is [Noita](https://github.com/penibelst/jekyll-noita). Google Analytics is used for monitoring traffic. Posts are occasionally edited with [Prose](http://prose.io/).
