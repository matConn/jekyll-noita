## LARGE HEADER HERE

A pointer variable, or pointer for short, is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. A pointer's value will look like an integer in that it will be a number (and may even appear signed) but it is not; it is an address.  
For example:
```
// An integer with an arbitrary value.
int x = 2;

// Our pointer variable; a type and a name is declared like any other variable, however, an asterisk (the dereference operator) is placed anywhere between the variable's type and name, denoting that it is a pointer.
int *ptr;

// 
 
```
