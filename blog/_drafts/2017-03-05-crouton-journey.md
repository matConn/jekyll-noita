I love my Chromebook (as evidenced in [this](http://mattconn.club/blog/2016/chromebook-web-development/) post); I bring it everywhere as it comes in handy for long commutes and weighing in at around 3 pounds, isn't the least bit cumbersome.  

However, the restrictions ChromeOS places on me have been noticable REVISE since the beginning. I had always been aware of the restrictions ChromeOS had placed on the user, despite how useful Google's productivity suite (namely Google Docs, Keep, and Drive) had proven to be. Even before I had pruchased the notebook bearing Google's name, I had a couple of plans to bypass these restrictions; either dual-boot some flavor of Linux (Ubuntu, or Lubuntu if the hardware could not handle Unity's animations (it handled them perfectly)), or simply wipe the whole machine with a full install of Linux.  

I had done this before with a laptop running Windows, and with an old Macbook 2008 someone had given to me. Much to Apple's credit, it has always been extremely easy to either dual boot a separate OS (Windows via BootCamp) or to perform a complete install of an OS of your choice.  

In the case of my 2008 Macbook, GRUB loader was used to effectively reformat and install Lubuntu onto the hard disk. In the case of the Windows laptop, I could boot into the BIOS (something Macbooks do not have in favor of some version of "safe mode" or "verbose mode"), and from there select boot order to then boot off of a my thumb drive formatted with the Lubuntu image. The aforementioned procedures could not have been any easier nor gone any smoother after connecting to the internet via ethernet cable; some package related to GRUB itself (if I remember correctyl) would not install without an internet connection, and the whole OS installation would fail because of this.

Enter the Chromebook. Thanks to Crouton, I coul
